# NeRD-J

A discord bot to play music in the NeRD workshop room.

# How to use

## Is the NeRD-E backend up and running?
Install requirements and run nerdj_smart.py AND nerdj_helper.p3 

## Standalone
Install requirements and run nerdj_simple.py

# Debug

### Is the bot not working?

BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE 
Run the command `?fix` in #bot-spam (Discord)


If you change the name of the python scripts also update run.sh -- this is run by the systemctl service `nerdj`!
`sudo systemctl restart nerdj`
